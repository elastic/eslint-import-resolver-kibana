# eslint-import-resolver-kibana

Resolver for Kibana imports, meant to be used with [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import).

## Usage

In your `.eslintrc.(yml|json|js)` file, add the following `import/resolver` under `settings`:

```yml
# .eslintrc.yml
settings:
  # uses 'eslint-import-resolver-kibana':
  import/resolver:
    - node
    - kibana
```

The `node` resolver isn't strictly required, but the resolving rules are unlikely to work as you expect if you don't include it in the list of resolvers. It's only included by default if you don't specify other resolvers.

The resolved assumed that the Kibana path exists at the same level as your plugin. If your Kibana path is somewhere else, you can specify it in the resolver settings, like so:

```yml
# .eslintrc.yml
settings:
  import/resolver:
    kibana: { kibanaPath: '/path/to/kibana' }
```

See [the resolvers docs](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import#resolvers) or the [resolver spec](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/resolvers/README.md#resolvesource-file-config---found-boolean-path-string-) for more details.

## Configuration

Property | Default | Descritpion
-------- | ------- | -----------
kibanaPath | `../kibana` | Relative path to the kibana root
rootPackageName | | The `name` property in the root `package.json` file, required when your plugin has multiple plugins with their own`package.json` files
pluginDirs | `[]` | Array of additional directories to check for Kibana plugins
pluginPaths | `[]` | Array of additional paths to look in when resolving plugin dependencies

## Debugging

For debugging output from this resolver, run your linter with `DEBUG=eslint-plugin-import:resolver:kibana`.

This resolver makes heavy use of *eslint-import-resolver-webpack*, and you can get debugging output from both resolver by using `DEBUG=eslint-plugin-import:resolver:*`.
